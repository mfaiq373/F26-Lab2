# Purpose: Learn how to use while loops.
# Usage: ./lab2h.py

# TO DO 1: 
# Creat variable timer.
# The value of timer should initially be 10.
# Use a while loop to create program that counts down from 10 with timer to 1.
# When you reach 1 end the loop and print blast off!

timer=10
while timer != 0:
    print(timer)
    if timer ==1:
            print("blast off!")
    timer=timer-1
